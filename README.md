## **_About Me_**

 As a 25 year old woman of mixed ethnicities, I have a committed desire to become a full stack web developer. With working for the past 5 years I have built a strong work ethic and achieved supervisory positions at both Starbucks and my neighborhood cafe. During leisure time, I enjoy attending museums, coding meetups, and botanical gardens as an amateur photographer. Having grown up in Harlem, seeing the lack of opportunities, my goal is to be able to mentor in impoverished communities such as mine. Since September I have self taught myself the basics of HTML,CSS and JavaScript.

### **_Becoming a TKH Innovation Fellow_**

 My interest in coding peaked at a young age from styling my own blog and being asked to style other peoples blogs. As years went on it has shown evident that a career in coding is the future, and my interest in coding has grown. Becoming apart of TKH fellowship is important to me because it gives me the opportunity to learn coding from a professional, in a classroom filled with people who come from a similar background as mine. Not only do I want be apart of the fellowship, but I also want to excel in the program, I want to be able to be on the right track to accomplishing my career goal.
